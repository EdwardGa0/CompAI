# CompAI
<p>App to help players with pick/ban in League of Legends. Currently gathering data on top players' games using NodeJS worker and storing in MongoDB.
Once the dataset is large enough, I'll explore the ML component of predicting win/loss based on team composition. After that I'll build the frontend.
Currently, match gathering is rate limited by Riot's API.
